# White Paper

The "Digital Mycorrhiza" white paper provides an overall overview of the technical ecosystems' current state and evolution. It also introduces a digital model for describing such ecosystems (the "digital mycorrhiza" concept and standard for data markup). 

As of now, this document is in a draft stage and is available only on Russian. We are targeting translating it into English in early 2020.
